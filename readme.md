# Depy
#####Simple and dependency free deployment tool.  
Written in bash 4 the tool does not have any other dependencies than `ssh` and `rsync` which are basic tools for any *nix OS and Windows 10 with Ubuntu.
 
 All you need is to download `depy` file and place it in a directory which is in your `$PATH`. For Ubuntu and macOS the directory `/usr/local/bin` is perfect for this case. You can do it easily with:
 
 ```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivandokov/depy/master/depy; sudo mv depy /usr/local/bin/depy
```

## Usage

Initialize depy for current directory / project.
```bash
depy init
```

Setup server with name `<server>`
```bash
depy setup <server>
```

Deploy to server with name `<server>`
```bash
depy deploy <server>
```
